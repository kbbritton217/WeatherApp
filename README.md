# WeatherApp


This is a small app that consumes the API for [OpenWeatherMap.org](http://openweathermap.org/api) as well as the [darksky.net](https://darksky.net/dev/docs) API.

I was able to create this app after studying the [NYTimes API](https://developer.nytimes.com/) and building a similar app to pull up articles from a tutorial.

Feel free to clone or download. It is just client side and does not have any dependencies. Or, you can view a deployed version by clicking [HERE](https://weatherapp-kbb.firebaseapp.com).

Please note that the deployed version is still under construction.
